<h1>The Best Movies According to ME (Lucero)</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies So Far</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>All time favorite, really great movie about loving yourself and others for who they are inside. Ogres are like onions, they have layers!</p>
<h3>Trolls</h3>
<p>This kids movie has snuck it's way into my heart. I love the songs they include in all the Trolls movies and the overall message is always lovley.</p>
<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>My comfort movie. I love Ryan... that's it I just love him. His dynamic with Sandra is so good and of course Betty white is in it so it's automatically ICONIC!</p>
