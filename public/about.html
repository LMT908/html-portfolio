<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Lucero. I am just starting to learn about coding and HTML. This course has been really fun to follow and I've been enjoying learning all these new skills.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Service Desk Tech for FanDuel. I have been in this position for about 2 years. </p>

<p>I hope to learn HTML and become a Web Developer so that I can start my career.</p>
